# Eloquent Javascript Exercises

I am going to try Exercises of Marijn Haverbeke's [**Eloquent Javascript**](http://eloquentjavascript.net/code) in Coffeescript.

Inspired by Kalisa Falzone's work [here](https://github.com/KalisaFalzone/EloquentJavascript).

And I have seen it's good to practice Coffeescript for working with React from [a blog post](https://www.airpair.com/reactjs/posts/reactjs-a-guide-for-rails-developers) written by Fernando Villalobos. 

> Personally, when I am working with CoffeeScript, I prefer using the React.DOM syntax over JSX because the code will arrange in a hierarchical structure by itself, similar to HAML.
