# Eloquent Javascript Exercises

I am going to try Exercises of Marijn Haverbeke's [**Eloquent Javascript**](http://eloquentjavascript.net/code) in Coffeescript.

Inspired by Kalisa Falzone's work [here](https://github.com/KalisaFalzone/EloquentJavascript).

And I have seen it's good to practice Coffeescript for working with React from [a blog post](https://www.airpair.com/reactjs/posts/reactjs-a-guide-for-rails-developers) written by Fernando Villalobos.

[How to install Coffeescript](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/javascript/coffeescript.html)

```sh
$ npm install --global coffee-script
$ coffee file_name
```
